\section{Issues}
If the user encounter any issue by using the platform \textit{EmporioLambda} or have a question on its use he can send us a mail with \href{mailto:techsweave@gmial.com}{techsweave@gmial.com}. He can also use our GitHub's issues page reachable at \href{https://github.com/techsweave/eml-fe/issues}{https://github.com/techsweave/eml-fe/issues}.
To allow us to understand the problem correctly the user has to specify:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the user type (unauthenticated, customer or vendor);
    \item the browser where he's affecting the issue and its version;
    \item if the problem is repeatable, the sequence of steps that lead to it. Otherwise, what happened and what was the user trying to do;
    \item if possible the browser console log (reachable by pressing {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont 'F12'} and opening the console tab or with the shortcut {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont 'ctrl+shift+k'}).

\end{itemize}
