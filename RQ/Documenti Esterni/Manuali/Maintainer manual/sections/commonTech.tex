\section{Common technologies and libraries}
\subsection{Typescript}
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical
superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the
development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript,
existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

\subsection{JSON}
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that
uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and
array data types (or any other serializable value).
JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript,
but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data.

\subsection{npm}
npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages,
called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and
searched via the npm website.

\subsection{yarn}
Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while
remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster,
more securely, and more reliably.
